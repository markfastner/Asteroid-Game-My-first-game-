# Asteroid-Game-My-first-game-

I created this game after I took my first coding class(Ap cs) in the summer following my sophomore year.I had just learned java and was exciting to do with it as much as possible.

I did some research into how to create basic gui and got to work. I jumped straigt into game developement after doing some research and after a lot of trail and error was able to get a shape moving across the screen with wasd controlls. Fasinated by the limitless potential I just discovered I spent hte next several weeks planning out and implemented my own fleshed out unique, astroid inspired game. I spent my whole summer working on my game adding new modes and features. My family planning a vacation to europe didnt stop me as I continued to code on my phone.

Unforuntatly I lost the code for the Program but I do still have two different versions of my game that can be palyed through executible jar files taht are in this repository.

In both games you control a square and must fend off enemies of different shapes using your blaster. One game is more fleshed out with a variety of powerups and  enemies. The other game is simple but contains a chasing feature which allows enemy triangles to follow you across the map.
